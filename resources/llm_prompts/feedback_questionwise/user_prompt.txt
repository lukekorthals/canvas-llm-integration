<feedback>Great job simulating data in R. Here are some tips for improving your code further:

1. **Avoid redundant code:** Instead of `rnorm(100)` and `runif(100)`, you can define a variable holding the number of samples and reusing it. 
    ```{r} 
    n <- 100
    x <- rnorm(n)
    y <- runif(n)
    ```  

If you want to learn more about simulating data in R, consider asking the following question during the next lecture: *`From what distributions can we sample random data in R?`*</feedback>
