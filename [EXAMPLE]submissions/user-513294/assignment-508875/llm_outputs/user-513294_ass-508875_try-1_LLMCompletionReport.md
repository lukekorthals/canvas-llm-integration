	Your goal is to give helpful, specific and detailed feedback that will improve the learning of your student without overwhelming them.
	Point out errors your student made and how to avoid them in the future.
	If there are no errors but the student could improve their code otherwise, give them concise advice on that.
	If everything is perfect, let the student know that they did a good job and avoid overly long text.
	Relate your feedback to the learning goals tied to the question.
	
	Importantly, make your feedback as concise as possible and only include information that helps the student.
	Don't write unnecessary text, if there is nothing to improve.

	<my-thoughts>
	- The student has correctly followed the task instructions to create or rename a folder and used the `setwd` function correctly.
	- The directory path used in `setwd` points to what seems a reasonable place where they might store course materials.
	- They didn't include trailing paths to the actual expected week_1 subdirectory.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Great job using the `setwd` function to set your working directory in R. However, to fully meet the task requirements, make sure to include the path up to the `week_1` subfolder. For example:
	```{r}
	setwd("/Users/lukekorthals/Desktop/repos/pips-course/r_course/week_1")
	```
	This will ensure that the working directory is specifically set to the `week_1` subfolder, which was part of the task.

	- The code correctly assigns values to `hours_sleep` and `reported_happiness`.
	- It correctly attempts to add the two variables.
	- The correct comment is included explaining why the addition doesn't work.
	</my-thoughts>
	
	<feedback>Great work on understanding and applying the concept of variables and data types in R. Your code accurately captures the required assignments and demonstrates an understanding of why the addition fails.
	
	Here's a small improvement for clarity:
	1. **Use comments to elaborate further:** It might be useful to mention the `typeof()` function to check data types. This can be instructive for understanding why the addition fails:
	    ```r
	    typeof(hours_sleep) 
	    typeof(reported_happiness) 
	    ```

	<my-thoughts>
	- The student correctly simulates the data using `rnorm(100, 7.5, 1)`, which matches the requirement of creating grades.
	- The indexing part `[c(1, 20, 80)]` is correctly implemented and returns the right elements.
	- However, the student did not sort the vector before accessing the elements.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>You're on the right track with generating and indexing the grades. However, you missed the step of sorting the grades before indexing. 
	
	Here's the corrected code:
	```R
	grades = sort(rnorm(100, 7.5, 1))
	grades[c(1, 20, 80)]
	```
	
	This ensures that your grades are sorted before you index them. 
	
	If you want further clarification on this concept, you could ask: *What are other efficient ways to sort and subset data in R?*</feedback>

	- The use of `gsub` is correct for substituting characters in the vector.
	- The code correctly identifies the "." character to be replaced with "a".
	- However, the result of the replacement is not stored back into the `fruits` variable.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Good attempt at solving the problem using the `gsub` function in R. You are almost there! Here are a couple of pointers:
	
	1. **Storing Results:** When you use `gsub`, ensure you store the result back into the `fruits` variable or a new variable to reflect the changes.
	    ```r
	    fruits <- gsub("\\.", "a", fruits)
	    ``` 
	
	By making this change, the new `fruits` vector will have the corrected characters.

	<my-thoughts>
	- The student correctly converted the factor to numeric and used the mean function.
	- But the issue lies in the levels of the factor itself.
	- Factors in R have levels stored as characters; hence `as.numeric(levels(horrible_numbers))` retrieves the levels, not the actual values.
	- Also, "NA" as a string should be translated to NA for proper numeric conversion.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>You are on the right track with your solution, especially by converting the factor and handling NA values. However, working with factors requires careful conversion. Here's how you can improve your code:
	
	1. **Convert factor to numeric directly, including handling "NA" correctly:**
	    ```r
	    horrible_numbers <- factor(c("25", pi, "NA", 1))
	    numeric_values <- as.numeric(as.character(horrible_numbers))
	    mean(numeric_values, na.rm=TRUE)

	- The student's code sets a seed for reproducibility using `set.seed(1234)`, which is good.
	- The use of `sample()` to generate a random number of rows and columns achieves the goal of creating a random matrix.
	- The matrix `m` is created correctly with the generated dimensions.
	- The student uses `dim(m)` to display the dimensions of the matrix, which fulfills the requirement.
	- The missing values are implicitly added by default with `NA` when creating a matrix without specifying data, although it could be more explicit to show that the matrix is intentionally filled with missing values.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Great job setting the seed for reproducibility and using the `sample()` function to generate random dimensions for the matrix. Your code effectively creates a matrix and shows its dimensions. Here are a couple of tips to improve your code further:
	
	1. **Explicitly fill the matrix with missing values (NA):** While your matrix is filled with `NA` by default, it's good practice to explicitly state this for clarity.
	    ```r
	    m = matrix(NA, nrow = n_rows, ncol = n_cols)
	    ```
	
	This makes it clear to anyone reading your code that the matrix is intentionally filled with missing values.

	- The student correctly identified EEGData3 as incorrect due to swapped dimensions.
	- The explanation provided regarding function arguments is correct but could use some further detail.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Well done identifying that EEGData3 is incorrect because it has 201 rows and 1325 columns. Your understanding of how the order of arguments in functions matters is also accurate. Here are a few suggestions to improve your explanation:
	
	1. **Specify function arguments explicitly:** To avoid mistakes, always specify arguments explicitly when dealing with functions that have multiple parameters.
	    ```R
	    EEGData3 <- matrix(runif(n_subjects*n_vars), nrow=n_subjects, ncol=n_vars)
	    ```
	
	2. **Check arguments when reading code:** When reading and debugging code, always check function arguments and their defaults if not specified.
	
	Your comment about the order and necessity of explicitly specifying function arguments is a good learning point. Keep practicing to solidify your understanding of function arguments and matrix operations in R.

	<my-thoughts>
	- The initial code uses `sum(M)`, which sums all TRUE values in the matrix, resulting in a single number.
	- The task requires summing correct responses per participant, implying row-wise summation.
	- The student's code uses `colSums(M)`, generating column sums instead of row sums.
	- The correct approach would be to use the `rowSums()` function to sum the TRUE values for each row.
	- The student's approach demonstrates understanding of matrix operations and built-in functions.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>You did a good job in identifying the need to sum across the matrix, and correctly used vectorized functions. However, to get the number of correct responses per participant (row-wise summation), you should replace `colSums(M)` with `rowSums(M)` like this:
	
	```{r}
	#WRITE YOUR CODE INTO THIS CELL (edit 1 line of code)
	set.seed(1234)
	rows <- 20 -> cols 
	M <- matrix(sample(c(T, F), rows*cols, replace = T), rows, cols)
	rowSums(M) 
	```
	
	This adjustment will compute the number of correct responses for each participant.

	<my-thoughts>
	- The original code attempts to modify the diagonal elements of a matrix but misses proper index selection.
	- The student replaced the problematic code with a more straightforward approach.
	- The original attempt used `diag(relationship_matrix)`, which is correct but could have been more explicit with the operation performed on the matrix.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>You've made a good start by identifying the built-in function `diag` and understanding its role in matrix operations. 
	
	1. **Code Improvement:** Your final approach is accurate and works perfectly by directly assigning `NA` to the diagonal of the matrix:
	    ```r
	    diag(relationship_matrix) = NA
	    ```
	
	2. **Understanding Indexing in R:** To make it clear, `diag(matrix)` accesses the diagonal elements directly as a vector, allowing simple assignment of missing values.
	
	Good job on simplifying the task and making your code more readable. Next time, ensure to verify the output to confirm that your changes have the intended effect.
	
	If you want to delve deeper into matrix manipulation, you might ask: *`How can we access specific submatrices or rows and columns in an R matrix efficiently?`*</feedback>

	<feedback>Your solution is almost perfect! You successfully created a boolean variable to indicate whether a student passed the class based on their final grade and exam grade. To fully complete the task, you need to add a step to print the IDs of the students who passed. Here's an updated version of your code:
	
	```{r}
	grades$passed = grades$final_grade >= 5.5 & grades$exam >= 5.5

	- The student correctly installs and loads the necessary packages.
	- They use `say()` from the cowsay package, and correctly generate a quote from the statquotes package.
	- Using `sample()` ensures a different animal is chosen each time the code runs.
	- Package installation inside the script is not always necessary.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Great job working with packages and generating dynamic output in R! Here are a couple of tips to streamline your code:
	
	1. **Avoid unnecessary package installations**: Package installation commands (`install.packages()`) should usually be run separately outside of your script to avoid reinstalling packages each time you run the code. Your code after the packages are installed would look like this:
	    ```{r}
	    library(statquotes)
	    library(cowsay)
	    
	    say(statquotes::statquote()$text, by = sample(names(cowsay::animals), 1))
	    ```
	
	2. **Improving readability**: Adding relevant comments can make your code easier to understand for others and yourself when you revisit it later.
	
	If you want to dive deeper into working with R packages, consider asking the following question in your next lecture: *"Are there best practices for managing and installing R packages in different environments?"*</feedback>

	<my-thoughts>
	- The code produces a vector in four different ways, which matches the task requirements.
	- However, the method `seq(1:3)` is incorrect; it should be written as `seq(1, 3)`.
	- The repetition method with `rep` could be more concise.
	- The `typeof(vec)` function is correctly used to check the vector's datatype, but it's called only once, and it reflects the type of the last defined vector.
	- The student overwrites the variable `vec` each time, losing the previously defined vectors.
	</my-thoughts>
	
	<feedback>Good attempt at creating vectors in R. Here are some suggestions for improvement:
	
	1. **Correct the `seq` function usage:** Instead of `seq(1:3)`, you should use `seq(1, 3)`:
	    ```r
	    vec3 <- seq(1, 3) 
	    ```
	
	2. **Refactor `rep` usage:** To be more concise:
	    ```r
	    vec4 <- rep(c(1, 2, 3), times = 1)
	    ```
	
	3. **Preserve all vectors:** Ensure you create unique variable names for each vector to avoid overwriting:
	    ```r
	    vec1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
	    vec2 <- 1:3
	    vec3 <- seq(1, 3)
	    vec4 <- rep(c(1, 2, 3), times = 1)
	    ```
	
	4. **Check the data types of all vectors:**
	    ```r
	    typeof(vec1)
	    typeof(vec2)
	    typeof(vec3)
	    typeof(vec4)
	    ```
	
	Here's how your revised code might look:
	```r
	vec1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
	vec2 <- 1:3
	vec3 <- seq(1, 3)
	vec4 <- rep(c(1, 2, 3), times = 1)
	
	typeof(vec1)
	typeof(vec2)
	typeof(vec3)
	typeof(vec4)
	```

	- The student correctly demonstrated how to subset and index a row, a variable, and a specific cell.
	- The student did not provide a description or context for the built-in dataset.
	- The code itself is accurate and shows correct usage of indexing in R.
	- However, providing comments for each line of code would improve readability and understanding.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>
	Great job demonstrating the concept of indexing using the `cars` dataset. Your code accurately shows how to select a row, a variable, and a specific cell. Here are a couple of suggestions to improve your submission:
	
	1. **Define the dataset being used:** It is a good practice to explicitly mention that you are using a built-in dataset and, optionally, provide a brief description. 
	    ```r
	    # Using the built-in 'cars' dataset in R
	    data(cars)
	    ```
	
	2. **Add comments to improve readability:** Adding comments helps others (and yourself) understand the purpose of each line.
	    ```r
	    # Select the first row
	    cars[1, ]
	    
	    # Select the 'speed' variable (column)
	    cars$speed
	    
	    # Select the first cell in the 'speed' column
	    cars$speed[1]
	    ```
	Including these comments will make your code more readable and provide better context.
	
	If you want to delve deeper into indexing and subsetting datasets, consider asking the following question during the next lecture: *"What are some advanced techniques for data subsetting in R?"*

	- The student's code successfully simulates a categorical and a continuous variable.
	- The categorical variable `animal` is correctly set up with "cat" and "dog" values.
	- The continuous variable `cuteness` uses normal distributions with different means, which satisfies the requirement of having one group higher on average.
	- Variables are not put into a dataframe as required by the task.
	- The variable names `animal` and `cuteness` are informative but the dataframe creation step is missing.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Great job simulating the categorical and continuous variables! Your choice of normal distribution for the continuous variable and setting the seed for reproducibility are both excellent practices. 
	
	Here's how you can improve your code further:
	
	1. **Create a dataframe:** You need to combine the variables into a dataframe to fulfill the task requirements.
	    ```r
	    data <- data.frame(animal=animal, cuteness=cuteness)
	    ```
	
	2. **Combine your code:** Including the dataframe creation, your entire code will look like this:

	- The use of `is.na()` to find missing values is appropriate and matches the task purpose.
	- The imputation logic using `mean(dat$values, na.rm=TRUE)` is correct.
	- However, the code lacks sufficient comments explaining each step.
	- There's a small potential issue: the imputation replaces all NAs in the dataframe, which might include columns other than the intended one in other contexts.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Good job creating and dealing with missing values in your dataset! Here are a few suggestions to improve your code:
	
	1. **Add more comments**: Enhance your explanation for each step to match the code's logic, which will make it easier to understand.
	    ```r
	    # Creating a vector of random values with two NAs
	    values = c(rnorm(100), NA, NA)
	    
	    # Creating a data frame with two columns: group and values
	    dat = data.frame(group = rep(c("A", "B"), each=51), values = values)
	
	    # Imputing NAs in 'values' column with the mean of non-missing values
	    dat$values[is.na(dat$values)] = mean(dat$values, na.rm=TRUE)
	    ```
	
	2. **Target specific columns for NA imputation**: Ensure you are only imputing NAs in specific columns.
	    ```r
	    # Imputing NAs only in the 'values' column
	    dat$values[is.na(dat$values)] = mean(dat$values, na.rm=TRUE)
	    ```
	
	If you want to learn more about different imputation methods, consider asking: *`What are other imputation methods besides the mean, and when should we use them?`*</feedback>

	Great job finding an interesting discussion and clearly stating why you found it intriguing!

	2. **Expand slightly on your reasoning**: You could include a bit more detail to explain why the discussion grabs your interest, such as potential performance implications or common misunderstandings, to show deep engagement with the topic.

	- The student successfully uses `read.csv` to load the dataset from the URL, which shows understanding of reading files in R.
	- The plot command is correctly used to visualize a specific column of the dataset.
	- There's no specification of the type of plot, which defaults to a scatter plot for the `plot` function.
	- Using a column name like `dat$Sadness` implies the student understands how to access data within a dataframe.
	- The plot is basic; adding customization would enhance the visualization.
	</my-thoughts>
	
	<feedback>You're on the right track with reading a dataset from a URL and visualizing a specific column in R. Here are a few ways to improve your code:
	
	1. **Add Axis Labels and Title:** Providing axis labels and a title can make your plot easier to understand.
	    ```r
	    plot(dat$Sadness, main="Sadness Levels", xlab="Index", ylab="Sadness Score")
	    ```
	2. **Check for Missing Data:** Before plotting, it's good practice to check for and handle any missing data.
	    ```r
	    sum(is.na(dat$Sadness)) # This will help you find out if there are any missing values in the 'Sadness' column.

	- The Python code should run correctly as it correctly converts the string "6" to an integer before addition.
	- The student correctly identified the equivalent R function `as.numeric()` for converting a string to a numeric type.
	- The student provided the equivalent R function but didn't provide the actual R code translation in their response.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Great job identifying the `as.numeric()` function in R as the equivalent to `int()` in Python. Here's how you can write the equivalent code in R for better clarity:
	
	```{r}
	# The Python equivalent code written in R
	first_number <- 5
	second_number <- "6"
	first_number + as.numeric(second_number)

	<my-thoughts>
	- The student's code fixes the original issue by using the `.copy()` method, which correctly creates a true new copy of the numpy array.
	- The explanation provided by the student is correct; in Python, simply assigning one array to another essentially creates a reference to the same object.
	- The usage of `.copy()` to create an independent copy of the array is accurate and demonstrates an understanding of numpy array manipulation.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Great job identifying and fixing the issue by using the `.copy()` method. Your explanation about pointers and creating a new copy is spot on. Keep practicing to strengthen your understanding of how variables and references work in Python, especially with mutable objects like numpy arrays.

	- The student correctly used `np.arange` to generate the series of odd positive integers.
	- The step size in `np.arange(1, 100, step=2)` is correct.
	- The use of `np.prod` is appropriate for computing the product of all elements in the array.
	- It is concise and solves the problem accurately with minimal code.
	- The student followed the hint provided in the task.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Excellent job on using numpy to generate the series of odd numbers and compute their product. Your code is concise and correctly applies the `np.prod` and `np.arange` functions.
	
	A small suggestion for further improvement: 
	- Explicitly import numpy at the beginning of your script to avoid potential errors in a larger project or collaborative environment.
	
	Example:
	
	```python
	import numpy as np
	print(np.prod(np.arange(1, 100, step=2)))
	```
	
	This will make your code more robust and easier to understand for others who might read it.

	<my-thoughts>
	- The code correctly imports the pandas package and creates the dataframe.
	- The 'First_appearance' and 'Dating_appeal' columns were filled using shortcuts efficiently.
	- The 'Morality' column uses a shortcut that doesn't correctly match the desired values.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Your use of pandas to create the dataframe for LOTR characters is nearly perfect! You correctly used list multiplication for the 'First_appearance' column and `range` for the 'Dating_appeal' column. However, there is a small issue in how you generated values for the 'Morality' column. The current implementation creates an alternating pattern of ["Bad", "Good", "Bad", "Good", "Bad", "Good"], which doesn't match the provided table. Here's a slightly adjusted solution:
	```python
	import pandas as pd
	
	lotr_characters = pd.DataFrame({
	    'Name': ["Gollum", "Smeagol", "Sauron", "Frodo", "Shelob", "Samwise"],
	    'First_appearance': ["The Hobbit"]*3 + ["LOTR"]*3,
	    'Morality': ["Bad", "Good", "Bad", "Good", "Bad", "Good"],
	    'Dating_appeal': list(range(0, 11, 2))
	})
	```
	
	By explicitly defining the 'Morality' column values, it adheres to the values given in the table. Otherwise, excellent work!
	
	If you want to dive deeper, consider asking this question during the next lecture: *"What are other effective ways to create pandas dataframes when handling larger datasets?"*</feedback>

	1. **Avoid redundant code:** Instead of `rnorm(100)` and `runif(100)`, you can define a variable holding the number of samples and reusing it. 
	    ```<NOT PROVIDED> 
	    n <- 100
	    x <- rnorm(n)
	    y <- runif(n)
	    ```

	- The student imported the numpy module correctly.
	- They used `np.random.choice` to generate a list of 365 strings, which fits the requirement.
	- They used `np.random.normal` to generate 52 normally distributed IQ values, which is correct.
	- They used the correct mean and standard deviation for IQ.
	- The code meets the task requirements and the learning goals.
	</my-thoughts>
	<feedback>Your solution meets all the requirements of the task and demonstrates a good understanding of numpy and Python data structures. Excellent job!
	
	If you want to further enhance your code, you could add a seed for reproducibility, which is especially important in scientific experiments:
	```python
	import numpy as np
	np.random.seed(42)  # Setting the seed for reproducibility
	my_measurements = {
	  "my_mood_measurements": np.random.choice(["happy", "sad"], 365),
	  "my_iq_measurements": np.random.normal(100, 15, 52)
	}
	my_measurements
	```
	This will ensure that every time you run the code, you get the same results.
	
	If you want to learn more about simulating data in Python, consider asking the following question during the next lecture: *Why is it important to set a random seed when simulating data?* </feedback>

#### Prompts
<blockquote>
<strong>system</strong>

	You are a personal coding tutor giving your student feedback on their coding assignment. 
	The task may require the student to use R, Python or another programming language.
	
	Your goal is to give helpful, specific and detailed feedback that will improve the learning of your student without overwhelming them.
	Point out errors your student made and how to avoid them in the future.
	If there are no errors but the student could improve their code otherwise, give them concise advice on that.
	If everything is perfect, let the student know that they did a good job and avoid overly long text.
	Relate your feedback to the learning goals tied to the question.
	
	Importantly, make your feedback as concise as possible and only include information that helps the student.
	Don't write unnecessary text, if there is nothing to improve. 
	
	Finish with a short question the student could ask during the lecture if they require further input.
	Your output will be copied into markdown later and you can use formatting to make it easy to read for the student, but make sure to not use any headings.
	
	Go through this task step-by-step. First right down your thoughts step-by-step in a list. Then write your feedback. 
	
	Format your output using pseudo html tags: <my-thoughts>your list of thoughts</my-thoughts><feedback>your helpful feedback</feedback>
	For reference, a formatting example with example feedback for a different task is provided.

	- Without the details of the task and learning goals, it is difficult to provide specific feedback.
	- This should include remarks about the objective of the code and how well the student has met the learning goals.
	- Apart from pointing out the positives and negatives, I can provide general suggestions for improvement.
	- Encourage the student to ask a relevant question related to the task or learning goals.
	</my-thoughts>
	
	<feedback>Your code appears to be well-structured and achieves the expected outcome. Here are some general tips to elevate it further:
	
	1. **Comments and Documentation:** Ensure you document your code with comments to explain the logic behind each major step. It helps others (and yourself) to understand the code better during reviews or future edits.
	2. **Code Efficiency:** Look for any redundant computations or repeated code blocks. Defining reusable variables or functions can make your code more readable and maintainable.
	3. **Error Handling:** Add error handling, especially when dealing with user inputs or external data sources. This will make your code more robust and user-friendly.
	4. **Follow Naming Conventions:** Consistency in variable names and following a naming convention makes your code cleaner and more professional.
	
	If you are unsure about a particular aspect of your code or need more details on best coding practices, consider asking this during your next lecture: `Can we discuss best practices for commenting and documenting code effectively?` 
	
	Overall, keep up the good work!</feedback>
